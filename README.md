User Stories:
As a user, I want my product landing page to have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
As a user, I want to see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
Within the #header element I want to see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
I want to see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
As a user, when I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the la2ding page.
As a user, I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
As a user, my landing page should have a form element with a corresponding id="form".
Within the form, I want to see an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
Within the form, I want to see a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page.
The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
My product landing page should have at least one media query.
My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
